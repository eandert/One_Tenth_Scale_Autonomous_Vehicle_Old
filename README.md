# one_tenth_scale_autonomous_vehicle
This repository contains the control code for controlling a traxxis rc car equipped with a slamware M1M1 mapper and Nvidia Jetson Nano. This is a work in progress and will be updated with more thorough instructions later.

To install, download the SD card image and upload to 64 GB SD card. This will save days of building the correct libraries, etc. TODO: Place google drive link here. Clone this repo on the Home/Projects/ folder.

To run, simply type `CAV/python vehicle_control.py`
